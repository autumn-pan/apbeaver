# APBEAVER
This is just a repository for me to save my work on the Busy Beaver Function. I'm currently working on a Turing Machine simulator specialized for 6-state 2-symbol turing machines. In fact, the focus of my study is BB(6).

# Roadmap
Unaccelerated simulation has been added, but has not been tested on known halting machines. It also has not been expanded to comprehend certain syntax variants, which will be added in the near future. This is also unable to simulate a lot of more complex machines due to computational constraints. In one test, this system reached 36 billion steps in about 10 minutes on a BB6 holdout. The next goal is to create an accelerated simulator.
